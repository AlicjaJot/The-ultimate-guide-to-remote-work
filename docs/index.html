    <H1>How to work with SME? Instruction for technical writers</H1>

    <p>Technical writers can not work without the help of SME.</p> 
        
        <p>This is an instruction for the technical writers, which explains how to work with SME.</p>

<H2>SME - definition</H2>

    <p>The definition from the ClickHelp Software Documentation Glossary:</p> 
        
        <p>SME (subject-matter expert) is a person who has deep knowledge of a particular topic, function, process, machine, technology and so on. Technical writers develop manuals, documents, books with assistance from SME. SMEs help to convert information into a suitable form for the target audience, check written materials for technical accuracy and so on.</p>
        
        <h2>Main problems with the SME</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The SME does not have time to help the technical writer,</li>
    <li>Help technical writer is not an important task for SME,</li>
    <li>The SME can forget about meeting with the technical writer,</li>
    <li>The SME has a bad day and is unresponsive.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Solutions</H2>

<ul>
    <li>Set a deadlines with the SME,</li>
    <li>Always briefly describe what you need to discuss. The SME will know how much time it will take,</li>
    <li>Always be prepered for the meeting with the SME. Have a list of questions and drafts of your ideas. Do not ask the SME: "How would you do that?". Ask "What do you think about that draft/idea?",</li>
    <li>Be patient, but also firm.</li>
</ul>

    <H2>My own experience and conclusions</H2>

    <p>During my journalism studies, I did an internship in television. I had to work with a camera operator who did not respect me. He saw a young intern on his schedule and then just went out to take care of his private business instead of working with me. I had to deal with it. Quickly I noticed that he was not very popular in the firm. Every journalist treated him as an inferior manual worker who took poor pictures. And because of this, he actually took lousy pictures and disrespected me. Then I suddenly told him that the camera operators are the most important workers in every television because TV is based on image. He felt appreciated after many years of being disrespected. He began to work with me willingly, and everyone was surprised at how good pictures he was making.</p>

        <p>Let's say that the camera operator was my SME. I needed his help and his engagement.</p>

            <p>Try to <strong>get to know your expert</strong>. Find out if he prefers to talk on the phone or just send emails. Show him who you are outside of work. Tell him what you like, share cookies, and take him out for a nice lunch. A closer relationship promotes working together. He doesn't have time to clarify the obvious things, so don't ask about them. Be prepared.  And <strong>show your SME that helping you pays off for him</strong> because someday you will help him too or, thanks to your work, he won't have to write the documentation himself!</p>
